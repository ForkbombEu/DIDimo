## Current scope

Implement mandatory wallet-solution/relying-party tests one at a time. Skip TSL/MTSL, Digital Credentials API, W3C Digital Credentials API, and CAW tests. Keep reusable YAML in the repository, not SQLite.

## Aggregate validation architecture

On 27/08/2026, maintainer removed legacy FCAF orchestration. `/api/fcaf/run`, assessment/precondition workflows, catalog precondition definitions, and `fcaf run --tests-file` must stay removed. Validators consume exact named aggregate pipeline outputs directly.

Maintain 112 evidence-producing source definitions under `config_templates/fcaf/wallet_solution/relying_party/scenarios/`. `make fcaf-generate` combines them into one deployable pipeline, prefixes scenario step IDs, continues after scenario failures, merges 115 exact evidence sources, and runs one final `fcaf-validation` over all 559 tests. `pipelines/` contains only this generated complete-validation pipeline, so sync/run creates one top-level FCAF execution.

## Happy flow aggregate pipeline

On 31/08/2026 `cmd/fcaf-pipeline-gen` gained a third generated pipeline,
`fcaf-wallet-solution-relying-party-happy-flow-validation.yaml`: the
shared-evidence positive batch of the FCAF catalog, deliberately NOT the
complete assessment. `happyFlowScenarioNames` selects the 14 scenarios that
own every positive test batch (>= 5 positive tests each): 423 test IDs, 17
evidence sources, 53 steps, 21 mobile-automation actions. Excluded: all
negative tests and the fragmented one-test-per-interaction DCQL tail that
only the complete validation aggregate covers. Reuses only existing wallet
actions (`onboarding-1`, `getcredential-generic-credential-without-authentication`,
`fcaf-engagement-haip-vp`); no new Maestro actions are needed. The
maintainer rejected both a positives-only aggregate of all 75 positive
scenarios (500 tests, ~86 wallet actions, "full assessment minus negatives")
and a strict single-presentation flow (72 tests, below the 200+ check
expectation). Deployment to the fcaf-1 org on credimi.io: apply the CLI org
rewrite (`forkbomb-bv-andrea/` -> `fcaf-1/`), drop `runtime.global_runner_id`,
and upload the record; the webapp queue flow injects the UI-selected runner
as `global_runner_id` at queue time. `installed_from_external_source` is a
platform sentinel (use the wallet pre-installed on the runner), not a
wallet_versions lookup, and needs no org rewrite.

## Happy flow fcaf-1 deployment incident

The first credimi.io/fcaf-1 run of the happy flow pipeline (31/08/2026,
17:21) failed during workflow setup: `markExternalInstallSteps` resolved
`workflowengine.AsString(nil)` — the literal string `"<nil>"` — as an
action identifier for the eleven `installed_from_external_source` steps
that carry inline `action_code` and no `action_id`, so the canonify
validate endpoint returned CRE310 `invalid path "<nil>"`. Two-part remedy:

1. Repo fix (uncommitted in the fcaf-happy-flow worktree):
   `markExternalInstallSteps` now skips sentinel steps without a string
   `action_id`; regression test
   `TestMarkExternalInstallStepsSkipsInlineActionCodeSteps` fails on the
   unfixed code. Deploy with the next server release.
2. Instance-side pipeline shim (record `7j70w1pf7pqpl23`, patched 17:27):
   those eleven steps now declare
   `action_id: fcaf-1/eudiw-beta-wallet/fcaf-engagement-haip-vp`
   (category `verify-credential`, never `install-app`). Execution is
   unchanged because the mobile-automation child workflow runs
   `payload.ActionCode`, not the stored action; the shim only feeds the
   category lookup. Replace the shim with the repo fix once deployed.

The complete-validation pipeline hits the same setup bug on any current
server build; it is not fcaf-1-specific.

Every test has exactly one scenario owner. Do not restore sole-output fallback: one wallet interaction must never stand in for incompatible scenarios. A complete run may still contain many sequential wallet interactions. Mock-verifier-blocked tests must report blocked/failed from missing real evidence, never synthetic conformance passes.

## Case 087

The request uses two IDs, `pid-query-one` and `pid-query-two`, both matching PID SD-JWT VC `urn:eudi:pid:1` and requesting `given_name`.

Verified evidence:

- Two PID cards appeared in one consent screen.
- Both request accordions exposed `Given Name(s)`.
- Manual sharing succeeded to `EUDI Remote Verifier`.
- Both result accordions exposed the same expected given-name value.
- A fresh verifier transaction returned VP-token entries for both query IDs.

Follow-up: inventory row 087 still describes an earlier `Credential not found` failure. Reconcile it with the later successful evidence and run the final committed Maestro flow completely green after clearing Chrome.

## Cases 088 and 089

- 088: `trusted_authorities` contains `type: unsupported`.
- 089: `trusted_authorities` omits `type`.
- Both now use `mode: request_rejected`; do not revert to `no_match`.
- Emulator 089 returned Home after the malformed request, which is the allowed discontinuation outcome.

Follow-ups:

- Synchronize the emulator-tested 089 leaf flow with the pipeline's inline `action_code`; verify unlock before and after `openLink`.
- Rerun 088 on the emulator after the validator change.
- Review synthetic `json-parse` evidence containing `error: invalid_request`. The observed 089 behavior was discontinuation, not a displayed or captured `invalid_request` response.

## Case 090

OID4VP 6.1.1 defines the required property as plural `values`; the FCAF prose uses singular “value” descriptively. The implemented request keeps valid `type: aki` and omits `values`.

Assertions independently prove that `type` is present, `values` is absent, the request is rejected/discontinued, and visual evidence exists. A clean Maestro run after clearing Chrome returned the wallet to Home without consent or success, satisfying the allowed discontinuation outcome.

## Case 091

`WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__091` rejects `trusted_authorities.type` when it is not a JSON string. The implemented matrix covers `null`, `true`, `false`, `0`, a non-zero number, array, and object. Every request keeps `values` as a valid non-empty string array.

The dedicated `trusted_authority_property_type` validator proves the nested property is present and has the wrong JSON type, rejects evidence for a missing `type`, requires valid `values` while testing `type`, and fails if the wallet returns a credential. A clean Maestro run after clearing Chrome completed all seven variants. The final UI hierarchy showed Home, so the observed wallet behavior is allowed interaction discontinuation, not a captured `invalid_request` response.

## Case 092

`WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__092` rejects `trusted_authorities.values` when it is not a JSON array. The implementation uses the normative plural property despite the FCAF source's singular `value` wording; that discrepancy is already documented in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md`.

The matrix covers `null`, `true`, `false`, `0`, a non-zero number, string, and object while preserving `type: aki`. The nested validator requires `values` to be present, verifies its JSON type, requires `type` to remain a non-empty string, and fails if a malformed request returns a credential. A clean Maestro run after clearing Chrome completed all seven variants and produced seven screenshots.

## Case 093

`WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__093` rejects an array-valued `trusted_authorities.values` property when any array item is not a JSON string. The dedicated `trusted_authority_array_item_type` validator requires a non-empty outer array, a valid non-empty string `type`, and at least one item with the invalid type; an all-string array fails the malformed-item assertion. Unit coverage also includes a mixed string plus non-string array.

The matrix covers null, booleans, zero, a non-zero number, nested array, and object items. A clean Maestro run after clearing Chrome completed all seven variants and produced seven screenshots.

## Case 094

`WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages__094` rejects a normative `trusted_authorities.values` array containing an empty string. The dedicated `trusted_authority_empty_string_item` validator requires a valid non-empty string `type`, a non-empty array containing only strings, and at least one empty item; non-string items remain case 093 evidence.

The implementation covers a single empty string and a mixed valid-plus-empty array. A clean Maestro run after clearing Chrome completed both variants and produced two screenshots.

## Next candidate

## TextualEncoding 004

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_004` uses a dedicated Capture Wallet DCQL
scenario with the syntactically valid but reversed path
`["street_address", "address"]`. Capture's PID contains the contrasting valid
`address.street_address` claim, so the no-match and `access_denied` assertions
test left-to-right processing rather than merely a missing claim. The scenario
reuses the established no-match Wallet UI flow and retains exact session and
visual evidence.

## TextualEncoding 005

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_005` reuses the existing Capture Wallet
DCQL request for the top-level `given_name` path. The claims-subset validator
requires that exact requested path to be disclosed and `family_name` to remain
absent, proving selective disclosure of a named top-level attribute.

## TextualEncoding 006

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_006` uses a dedicated Capture Wallet query
for top-level `street_address`. Capture's PID has `address.street_address`,
but no root `street_address`, so the test distinguishes a non-matching
top-level claim pointer from a missing fixture. The source accepts a captured
error or interaction discontinuation; the validator rejects any presentation.

## TextualEncoding 007

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_007` uses the dedicated Capture Wallet path
`["given_name", "firstname"]`. Capture's standard PID exposes `given_name` as a
scalar, so applying the second member distinguishes a traversal-type error from
an absent claim. The `wallet_error_required` validator rejects both a
presentation and a silent discontinuation, requiring the protocol error stated
by the source.

## TextualEncoding 009

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_009` uses the dedicated Capture Wallet path
`["address", null, "street_address"]`. Capture's standard PID exposes
`address` as an object with `street_address`, so the null selector exercises
the required non-array failure rather than a missing claim. It reuses the
strict `wallet_error_required` validator to reject both a presentation and a
silent discontinuation.

## TextualEncoding 010

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_010` uses the dedicated Capture Wallet path
`["address", "street_address", 0]`. Capture's standard PID exposes
`address.street_address` as a scalar, so the final integer selector exercises
the required non-array failure. The source example uses a conflicting null
component, but its objective and expected result require a non-negative integer
component; the scenario follows those normative statements and requires an
error without a presentation.

## TextualEncoding 012

`WS_RP_SH_Encoding_TextualEncoding_012` uses the dedicated Capture Wallet path
`["address", "street_address", false]`. The Boolean is an unsupported DCQL
claim-path component, so the Wallet must reject the request before it can
produce a presentation. The scenario asserts the exact component type and
requires an error without a presentation.

## Next candidate

`WS_RP_SM_DeviceBinding__008` is the next runnable mandatory candidate. Case
119 duplicates case 114; cases 124-146 and 153-159 are intentionally skipped
where the required raw request, transaction-data fixture, or configurable
verifier response cannot be produced by the public service.

## Case 123

Capture Wallet accepts the source-defined `path: [true]` malformed
claim-path member and preserves it unchanged in its signed Authorization
Request. The dedicated scenario therefore exercises the Wallet directly.
Its strict `invalid_request_required` validator requires a captured
`invalid_request` and rejects both a presentation and a silent discontinuation.
The generated aggregate pipeline was refreshed; an emulator run remains needed
to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 122

Capture Wallet accepts the source-defined non-array `path: "given_name"` and
preserves it in the signed Authorization Request. The scenario therefore reuses
the strict `invalid_request_required` validator from case 123, requiring a
captured error and no presentation. An emulator run remains needed to establish
the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 121

Capture Wallet accepts the source-defined `path: [-1]` and preserves it in the
signed Authorization Request. The scenario reuses the strict
`invalid_request_required` validator, requiring a captured error and no
presentation. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference
Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 120

Case 120 uses the same source-defined `path: [true]` value as case 123. Its
dedicated scenario reuses the verified Capture Wallet delivery path and strict
`invalid_request_required` validator, requiring a captured error and no
presentation. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference
Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 115

The dedicated non-array claim-path scenario sends `path: "given_name"`, which
Capture Wallet preserves in its signed Authorization Request. Its
`claim_path_non_array` validator verifies the malformed structure and requires
the captured `invalid_request`; a presentation or a silent discontinuation
fails. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's
conformance result.

## Case 114

The dedicated empty claim-path scenario sends the source-defined `path: []`,
which Capture Wallet preserves in the signed Authorization Request. Its
`claim_path_empty` validator verifies the malformed structure and requires the
captured `invalid_request`; a presentation or a silent discontinuation fails.
An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance
result.

## Case 113

The dedicated missing claim-path scenario sends the source-defined claim object
without `path`, which Capture Wallet preserves in the signed Authorization
Request. Its `claim_path_missing` validator verifies the malformed structure
and requires the captured `invalid_request`; a presentation or a silent
discontinuation fails. An emulator run remains needed to establish the
reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 112

The dedicated invalid-claim-ID scenario sends `claim with spaces!`, which
Capture Wallet preserves in the signed Authorization Request. Its
`invalid_claim_id_characters` validator verifies the malformed ID and requires
the captured `invalid_request`; a presentation or a silent discontinuation
fails. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's
conformance result.

## Case 111

The dedicated empty-claim-ID scenario sends `id: ""`, which Capture Wallet
preserves in the signed Authorization Request. Its `empty_claim_id` validator
verifies the malformed ID and requires the captured `invalid_request`; a
presentation or a silent discontinuation fails. An emulator run remains needed
to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Mock-verifier skip queue

Do not implement the following negative cases with the public reference
verifier. Keep their inventory status at `missing` until a mock service can
deliver the required request and capture the Wallet's actual protocol result:

- 124: the public endpoint accepts an unknown field in its presentation-create
  JSON but strips it from the signed Authorization Request. A live probe on
  15/07/2026 confirmed `fcaf_unknown_parameter` was absent from the JWT.
- 125-126: the verifier response endpoint must deliberately return either HTTP
  200 with a non-JSON body or HTTP 400 with JSON after receiving the Wallet's
  response.
- 127-128: the response endpoint must return JSON containing an unknown
  parameter, and case 128 also needs an unknown signed request parameter.
- 129-132: the public result API returns only the decrypted Wallet response and
  does not expose the compact JWE. Therefore `kid`, explicit/default `enc`, and
  the original JWT payload structure cannot be asserted.
- 133-134: proving the HTTP method, content type, and exact form body requires
  capture at the Wallet-facing `response_uri`, which the public result API does
  not expose.
- 135: the source does not define a transaction-data type/fixture the Wallet is
  expected to support. Wallet core 0.28.1 explicitly rejects every non-empty
  `transaction_data`, so inventing a type would test case 136 instead.
- 136: the verifier must issue unsupported `transaction_data` and capture the
  Wallet error without opening credential selection.
- 137-140: the verifier must send unknown, malformed, or empty scopes and
  capture the exact `invalid_scope` response; case 140 must additionally prove
  session termination.
- 141-145: conflicting query/scope, missing query instructions, unsupported or
  insecure client identifiers, and conflicting stored client metadata all need
  custom signed requests plus exact Wallet error capture.
- 146: the trusted-registry and locally stored verifier metadata state needed
  to trigger `invalid_client` requires a stateful mock verifier/registry.
- 150: the public verifier rejects `format: vc+sd-jwt` during request creation
  with HTTP 400 `UnsupportedFormat`, before a signed request reaches the Wallet.
- 153-159: all require signed requests containing unsupported or malformed
  `transaction_data` and exact Wallet error capture. Cases 154-157 also require
  a supported transaction-data schema that the suite does not define.
- DeviceBinding 002-006: the public verifier request object contains no
  `verifier_info` attestation. These cases require a generator for valid,
  malformed, invalid-proof, and unknown-type Verifier Info attestations.

These are implementation skips, not conformance passes or accepted
discontinuations. See `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issues 13 and 19.

## Case 147

147 reuses `pipeline.dcql.no-matching-credentials`, which requests the
deliberately unavailable VCT `urn:credimi:fcaf:no-matching-test-credential`.
The tightened mobile flow clears Chrome, unlocks before opening the request,
requires the Wallet's unavailable-document screen, proves no requested-document
row exists, captures visual evidence, and only then selects `Go Back`. The protocol
assertions require no returned credential and an error value exactly equal to
`access_denied`; Home or a screenshot alone cannot pass the case.

The 15/07/2026 emulator run passed the UI portion: the reference Wallet showed
`The requested document is not available in your EUDI Wallet`, rendered no
credential row, left the Share control disabled, and allowed `Go Back`. It did
not submit an error response. The public
verifier poll returned HTTP 400 with an empty body because the transaction was
not in Submitted state. The reference Wallet therefore fails case 147; do not
weaken the exact `access_denied` assertion or treat the local error screen as a
protocol response.

## Case 148

148 uses a dedicated valid PID request and requires the Wallet to reach the
consent screen before the user explicitly denies consent. In wallet version
2026.06.38, the denial control has accessibility label `Go Back`; there is no
visible `Cancel` label and no confirmation dialog. Visual evidence is captured
both before and after denial. Protocol evidence must omit `vp_token` and contain
`error` exactly equal to `access_denied`; returning Home without a submitted
verifier response cannot pass.

The 15/07/2026 Maestro run passed the UI portion on `emulator-5554`: a valid PID
request reached `DATA SHARING REQUEST`, the first PID accordion exposed `Given
Name(s)`, and `Go Back` returned the Wallet to Home. The Wallet sent no error
response. Polling that exact verifier transaction returned HTTP 400 with an
empty body. The reference Wallet therefore fails case 148; keep the strict
protocol assertions.

## Case 149

149 uses a dedicated valid PID request, selects `Share`, and submits one known
invalid PIN (`111111`) at the transaction-authentication screen. The flow
requires the wallet's explicit `Invalid pin` state and captures it before any
cleanup. It then returns through the request screen to Home so later pipelines
start deterministically. Protocol evidence must omit `vp_token` and contain
`error` exactly equal to `access_denied`.

The 15/07/2026 reusable Maestro flow passed the UI portion on `emulator-5554`: the
Wallet displayed the requested PID and `Given Name(s)`, reached the PIN screen
after `Share`, and displayed `Invalid pin` after one failed attempt. It sent no
error response; polling the same verifier transaction returned HTTP 400 with
an empty body. This is partial evidence, not a conclusive case 149 execution:
one invalid PIN is a failed attempt while the authentication interaction still
allows retries. Completion needs a verifier web-form/manual flow that reaches a
defined terminal authentication failure and exposes the submitted authorization
error. The upstream scenario does not define whether one invalid attempt, terminal lockout,
biometric failure, or cancellation constitutes failed authentication; this is
tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 21.

## Cases 150 and 151

150 is mock-verifier blocked. A live public-verifier probe on 15/07/2026
rejected `format: vc+sd-jwt` during presentation creation with HTTP 400 and
`{"error":"UnsupportedFormat"}`; the Wallet cannot produce the required
`vp_formats_not_supported` response without receiving a signed request.

151 is not executable against the reference Wallet because its prerequisite
requires a Wallet that supports `vc+sd-jwt` but does not support `mso_mdoc`.
The reference Wallet supports `mso_mdoc`, so changing the requested document
type would test credential availability rather than format support.

## Case 152

152 starts from a valid public-verifier request URI and adds the deliberately
invalid `request_uri_method=DELETE` authorization parameter. The Maestro flow
requires the Wallet's generic error page, proves that neither `DATA SHARING
REQUEST` nor a requested-document row appears, captures visual evidence, and
returns to Home. Protocol assertions require no `vp_token` and error exactly
equal to `invalid_request_uri_method`.

The 15/07/2026 reusable Maestro flow passed and reached the generic `Oups!
Something went wrong` page, but the Wallet sent no error response. Polling the same verifier
transaction returned HTTP 400 with an empty body. The reference Wallet fails
case 152; do not treat the local generic error page as protocol evidence.

## Cases 153-159

These seven `invalid_transaction_data` cases are not runnable with the public
verifier. They require controlled signed request objects and exact Wallet error
capture. 153 is the exact-error specialization of blocked case 136. Cases
154-157 additionally require a known supported transaction-data type, schema,
field types, ranges, and mandatory fields; no such fixture is defined. Cases
158-159 require controlled `credential_ids` references. Keep them missing until
the mock verifier and transaction-data fixture tracked in Issues 13 and 20 are
available.

## DeviceBinding cases 002-006

A live public-verifier request-object probe on 15/07/2026 contained the normal
x5c-signed authorization request but no `verifier_info` attestation. Cases
002-006 need a controllable Verifier Info attestation generator and cannot be
adapted from that request without changing the signed object. They are tracked
as mock-verifier skips and in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 23.

## DeviceBinding case 007

007 reuses the successful PID SD-JWT all-claims presentation and validates the
issuer-signed `cnf` claim with `sdjwt.cnf_conforms`. The structural validator requires a
non-empty object in the issuer payload, exactly one RFC 7800 proof-of-possession
key representation, valid public EC/RSA/OKP JWK members without private key
material, unpadded base64url key values with curve-specific lengths, a compact
JWE, a non-empty key identifier, or an HTTPS JWK Set URL. Unknown members are
ignored only when a supported confirmation method remains present.

The mandatory `sdjwt.key_binding_matches_cnf` assertion preserves the exact
SD-JWT and compact KB-JWT bytes, verifies the KB-JWT signature with `cnf.jwk`,
enforces `typ: kb+jwt`, rejects unsecured or key-incompatible algorithms,
requires valid `iat`, `aud`, `nonce`, and `sd_hash` claims, and recomputes the
RFC 9901 `sd_hash` over the presented SD-JWT and selected disclosures. Wrong
keys, altered signatures, malformed mandatory claims, algorithm confusion, and
mismatched presentation hashes are covered by focused negative tests.

The shared precondition exposes both the existing singular `pid_sdjwt` output
for older tests and a `pid_sdjwt_presentations` collection for 007. Both 007
validators iterate the full collection and pass only when every returned
credential presentation passes; a failure or unresolved confirmation method is
reported with its presentation index. This prevents the first `query_0` member
from hiding a bad later credential.

Resolver note: `kid`, `jku`, and `jwe` remain valid structural RFC 7800
confirmation methods, but their cryptographic verification needs trusted
external key-resolution or decryption evidence. The cryptographic validator
returns `blocked`, never `pass`, when `cnf.jwk` is absent. A future resolver must
provide the resolved Holder key as evidence; network access must not be hidden
inside the pure validator.

Visual presentation evidence is exposed from the shared PID precondition. A
live reference-wallet run on 15/07/2026 left both stored PID credentials selected
(Filippo and the FCAF test user), displayed their requested claims, and sent two
SD-JWT presentations. Maestro completed the consent and success flow. The exact
verifier response was decoded as a two-member collection; each presentation
contained a distinct EC P-256 `cnf.jwk`, and both passed the structural check,
KB-JWT signature verification, and RFC 9901 `sd_hash` recomputation.

## DeviceBinding case 008

008 reuses the live `pipeline.dcql.holder-binding-type-boundary` valid-true
execution. Its test asserts the requested credential property
`require_cryptographic_holder_binding` equals the boolean `true` exactly, not
merely that it has boolean JSON type. The generic DCQL validator gained
`property_equals` with positive and false-value regression cases for this
purpose. The precondition decodes every returned SD-JWT from
`vp_token.pididentity01`, and 008 applies `sdjwt.cnf_conforms` to all of them.

On 15/07/2026 the public-verifier request with that exact property completed
through Maestro consent and success on `emulator-5554`. The verifier returned
two PID presentations under `pididentity01`; each had a valid `cnf.jwk`, and
the existing cryptographic checker also passed both KB-JWT signatures and
RFC 9901 `sd_hash` values. The reusable pipeline currently stores its visual
evidence as the holder-binding variant screenshot collection; 008 requires it
to be non-empty.

## Case 118

118 uses `claim_path_allowed_components` over one PID credential query with
three intended resolvable paths: `["given_name"]`,
`["nationality", null]`, and `["nationality", 0]`. The validator requires
non-empty path arrays, allows only strings, nulls, and non-negative integers,
requires evidence of all three categories, parses every returned SD-JWT, and
resolves every requested path against its disclosed claims. Unit evidence
rejects empty arrays, booleans, negative integers, fractional numbers, missing
component categories, missing presentations, and presentations that omit one
of the requested paths.

The public verifier accepted the combined request shape. A dedicated
`fcaf-test` Keycloak user was issued a fresh PID after its realm profile was
verified with `nationality: ["IT"]`, birth date, and structured birthplace.
On `emulator-5554`, the reference Wallet offered both the old Filippo PID and
the new FCAF PID. Expanding both consent rows showed only `Given Name(s)`;
`Nationality` was absent. Sharing completed and the verifier returned HTTP 200
with two presentations, but their only disclosures were respectively
`[salt, "given_name", "Filippo"]` and `[salt, "given_name", "FCAF"]`.
The strict Maestro flow therefore fails at the pre-share `Nationality`
assertion, and the protocol validator fails because neither nationality path
resolves. Keep both assertions strict; the observed Wallet behavior does not
satisfy case 118.

## Case 117

117 uses two distinct credential query IDs and omits `credential_sets`. The
existing `without_credential_sets` validator checks that the property is absent
and that the Wallet returns a non-empty presentation for every query ID; focused
unit cases prove that omitting either response entry fails. Maestro requires two
requested-document entries in one consent screen, expands both before sharing,
and expands both result entries after one Share/PIN interaction.

The request uses two distinct query IDs with the same PID `given_name` claim
constraint, and both may be satisfied by the same stored PID. Whether the upstream scenario instead
requires two distinct stored Credentials is ambiguous and is tracked in
`TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 16.

The reference-wallet Maestro run passed end to end on `emulator-5554`. The
post-link PIN must be entered digit by digit with zero settle time on the sixth
digit; otherwise Maestro waits through the short-lived request-screen
transition and observes Home. The Wallet displayed two PID request rows. One
tap on the first document expands both rows because their accordion state is
shared; both exposed `Given Name(s)` with value `Filippo`. After one Share/PIN
interaction, the success screen contained two document rows, both expanded by
one tap and both exposing `Given Name(s)`. The verifier returned HTTP 200 with
non-empty `pid-given-name` and `pid-given-name-copy` entries in `vp_token`.

The Wallet contains multiple matching PID instances and returned multiple
presentations under each query ID. Case 117 establishes the missing
`credential_sets` all-query requirement; cardinality when `multiple` is omitted
remains covered separately by case 071.

## Case 116

116 uses `claims_without_values` to require every claim to omit `values`, retain a valid non-empty string path, and produce a matching `vp_token` under the credential query ID. A parsed request or absence of an error cannot pass. The public verifier accepted the request shape and issued a request URI; the Maestro flow requires consent, PIN confirmation, and visible successful sharing.

The exact reusable Maestro flow failed because the reference Wallet did not show `DATA SHARING REQUEST`; the verifier transaction then returned HTTP 400 with an empty body. This is a failed case 116 result, not acceptance. Keep the strict presentation and successful-sharing assertions. The missing transaction diagnostics are tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 14.

## Case 115

115 uses `claim_path_non_array` with unit evidence for `null`, booleans, zero, a non-zero number, string, and object values. Missing paths, empty arrays, and valid non-empty arrays are explicitly excluded from this mode. Passing evidence requires no `vp_token` and a real `error: invalid_request`.

The public verifier rejected the representative string request with HTTP 400 because `ClaimPath` decoding expected an array, before the request could reach the Wallet. Device-level execution requires the raw mock-verifier service tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 13.

## Case 114

114 uses `claim_path_empty` to prove the `path` property is present as an empty array. It distinguishes this from a missing path, `null`, non-array values, and a valid non-empty path. Passing evidence requires no `vp_token` and a real `error: invalid_request`.

The public verifier rejected request creation with HTTP 400 while deserializing `ClaimPath` (`ClaimPath must not be empty`), before the request could reach the Wallet. Device-level execution requires the raw mock-verifier service tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 13. The source expected result contains the typo `invalid request_error`; Issue 15 records the upstream correction to `invalid_request`.

## Case 113

113 uses `claim_path_missing` to prove a claim object omits the `path` property. It explicitly distinguishes absence from present `null`, empty-array, and valid path values. Passing evidence requires no `vp_token` and a real `error: invalid_request`.

The public verifier rejected request creation with HTTP 400 while decoding `ClaimsQuery` because `path` is required, before the request could reach the Wallet. Device-level execution requires the raw mock-verifier service tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 13.

## Case 112

112 uses `invalid_claim_id_characters` to require a present non-empty claim `id` containing at least one character outside ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, and hyphen. Unit evidence covers dot, space, colon, slash, and non-ASCII input, plus the valid boundary `Name_01-test`. Passing evidence requires no `vp_token` and a real `error: invalid_request`.

The public verifier rejected request creation with HTTP 400 in `DCQLId.ensureValid`, before the request could reach the Wallet. Device-level execution requires the raw mock-verifier service tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 13.

## Case 111

111 uses `empty_claim_id` to prove the claim `id` property is present and exactly the empty string, distinguishing it from a missing ID and from non-empty IDs. Passing evidence requires no `vp_token` and an actual `error: invalid_request`; returning Home is not sufficient.

The public verifier rejected request creation with HTTP 400 in `ClaimId` validation (`Value cannot be be empty`), before the request could reach the Wallet. Device-level execution requires the raw mock-verifier service tracked in `TEST-AUTHOR-FEEDBACK.md` Issue 13.

## Case 110

The dedicated scenario sends two claims in the same credential query with the same non-empty `duplicated_name` ID. Capture Wallet accepts the request and preserves both IDs in its signed Authorization Request. The `duplicate_claim_ids` validator proves the duplicate, requires no `vp_token`, and requires a captured `invalid_request`; a duplicated ID across separate credential queries is explicitly not treated as this malformed case. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 109

The dedicated Capture Wallet scenario sends a credential query whose claim omits `id` and whose credential query omits `claim_sets`. Capture Wallet accepts and preserves that shape in its signed Authorization Request. The `claims_without_id_without_claim_sets` validator proves both omissions, validates the claim path, and requires a `vp_token` entry for the credential query ID; visual evidence is separately required. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 105

105 now has a dedicated `claims_present` validator requiring every credential query to contain a non-empty `claims` array, valid non-empty string paths, and a matching `vp_token`. The verifier accepted a fresh claims-bearing request and Maestro drove the wallet through PIN entry, but the wallet returned Home without showing the consent/share screen. Restarting the wallet process and retrying produced the same result.

TODO: finish 105 emulator diagnosis with runner-accessible wallet logcat and verifier transaction evidence. Direct ADB logcat is currently blocked because the sandbox cannot start the ADB smartsocket daemon; Maestro MCP can still inspect and drive the emulator. The verifier transaction endpoint returned HTTP 400 with an empty body after the wallet interaction.

## Case 106

106 uses a dedicated PID claim path, `claim_that_does_not_exist`, and the `claims_path_no_match` validator proves that the request contains a non-empty claim path and returns no `vp_token`.

Emulator evidence is incomplete: the verifier accepted the request, the Wallet accepted PIN `123456`, and then returned Home without consent or presentation. The verifier transaction endpoint returned HTTP 400 with an empty body. The source expects an observable `access_denied` response describing that no credentials match; current evidence proves only absence of a credential response. Keep this residual gap explicit until verifier diagnostics or protocol evidence are available.

## Case 107

107 uses the valid `given_name` path with a deliberately mismatched `values` constraint. The dedicated `claims_values_no_match` validator requires non-empty `path` and `values` arrays and proves that no `vp_token` is returned. A separate strict assertion requires the source-mandated `access_denied`; a silent discontinuation does not pass.

The emulator accepted the request and PIN, then returned Home without consent or presentation. The verifier transaction endpoint returned HTTP 400 with an empty body. As with 106, this proves no credential was returned but does not prove the source-required `access_denied` response or description.

## Case 108

The dedicated Capture Wallet scenario sends a credential query whose claim omits `id` while credential-level `claim_sets` is present. Capture Wallet accepts and preserves the malformed shape in its signed Authorization Request. The `claim_id_missing_with_claim_sets` validator proves the shape, rejects any presentation, and requires a captured `invalid_request`; visual evidence is separately required. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 100

The dedicated Capture Wallet scenario sends a `credential_sets.options` entry that references an unknown credential query ID. Capture Wallet accepts and preserves that malformed shape in its signed Authorization Request. The `credential_sets_options_invalid_references` validator proves the invalid reference, rejects any presentation, and requires a privacy-preserving error. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 098

The dedicated Capture Wallet scenario sends `credential_sets.options` as a string rather than an array. Capture Wallet accepts and preserves the malformed shape in its signed Authorization Request. The `credential_sets_options_non_array` validator proves the type error, rejects any presentation, and requires a captured `invalid_request`. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 097

The dedicated Capture Wallet scenario sends an empty `credential_sets.options` array. Capture Wallet accepts and preserves the malformed shape in its signed Authorization Request. The `credential_sets_options_empty` validator proves the empty array, rejects any presentation, and requires a captured `invalid_request`. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## Case 096

The dedicated Capture Wallet scenario omits `credential_sets.options`. Capture Wallet accepts and preserves the malformed shape in its signed Authorization Request. The `credential_sets_options_missing` validator proves the omission, rejects any presentation, and requires a captured `invalid_request`. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## CryptographicHash 001

The existing Capture Wallet DCQL scenario obtains a successful PID SD-JWT VP and now exposes its raw `vp_token` as `pid_sdjwt`. The `sdjwt.disclosure_digests_sha_256` validator requires disclosed claims, accepts the explicit or RFC default SHA-256 algorithm, and relies on the SD-JWT parser to recompute every disclosure digest and verify its `_sd` reference. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

## TextualEncoding 001

The existing Capture Wallet Encoding scenario sends a DCQL string path, `["given_name"]`, for the standard PID SD-JWT VC. The `claims_subset` assertion verifies that the string path resolves to a disclosed value and that the known unrequested sibling `family_name` is absent, proving selective claim resolution without requiring the source's unavailable Arthur Dent fixture. An emulator run remains needed to establish the reference Wallet's conformance result.

Each worktree contains an untracked `AGENT_TASK.md`. Agents own only test-specific artifacts. Shared integration files remain owned by the main worktree and must be updated after the four branches are reviewed/cherry-picked. Code work can run concurrently; emulator/Maestro runs cannot because all agents share `emulator-5580`.

## Wallet step editor compatibility (2026-09-01)

The pipeline editor could not display inline `action_code` mobile-automation
steps ("Invalid pipeline step data"): `walletActionStepConfig.deserialize`
requires `action_id`. The 11 happy-flow scenarios that used inline code now
reference two stored wallet actions synced from
`config_templates/fcaf/imports/forkbomb-bv-andrea/wallet/`:
`fcaf-exercise-wallet-generic` (generic capture-session exercise, `deeplink`
parameter, fixed `exercise-wallet` screenshot label) and
`fcaf-submit-request-object-by-value` (`CLIENT_ID`/`REQUEST_OBJECT`
parameters). Both keep `version_id: installed_from_external_source`, which the
editor resolves as the external version. The editor now also round-trips
arbitrary step `parameters` on edit instead of only `deeplink`.

The ~90 fragmented one-test DCQL scenarios in the complete-validation
aggregate still use inline `action_code` and remain flagged in the editor;
converting them needs their distinct mock-deeplink flow templates extracted
first (see scenario sources under `scenarios/fcaf-wallet-solution-relying-party-dcql-*`).
