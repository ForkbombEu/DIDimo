# ðŸš€ Publish on the Marketplace

Any registered user can publish Products and Services (Wallets, Issuers, Verifiers) on the Marketplace. 

In order to publish a Product/Service, first an organization must be configured. After that, there are different paths to create or import a Product/Service.

## Create an organization
When you sign-up as new User, an empty organization is also created. This organization can be edited in the Developer Dashboard. 

## Add a Product/Service
There are different paths to create Producs (typically Mobile Wallets) and Services (typically Credential Issuance and Verification): 

- Products (Wallets): the Product is created from scratch and later edited. The Product contains primarily metadata (name, description, logo, links). 

- Credential Issuance: upon entering an Issuer's URL in the Dashboard, all the Credentials offered by the Issuer are automatically created and populated. Following that, for each Credential, one or more deeplink (with a corresponding auto-generated QR Code) can be added, in order to allow visitors to test the Credential Issuance Flow with their Wallets.

- Credential Verification: (coming soon)
