# ðŸ§ª Testing and demo strategy

## 1. Technical Scope of Testing
### Modules and Functionalities to Be Validated:
1. **API Gateway**:
   - Validation of all API endpoints for compliance with the Google JSON Style Guide.
   - Test success and error responses, including edge cases for missing or invalid data.
   - Ensure robust handling of authentication and authorization.
   - CI testing with continous tests (Periodic run of stepCI on Github Actions)
   - Monitoring setup with a status page

2. **Compliance Engine**:
   - Validate individual compliance workflows for correctness and fault tolerance.
   - Test long-running tasks, including exponential retries and external signals.
   - CI testing with continous tests (Periodic run of stepCI on Github Actions)

3. **Plugin Management System**:
   - Verify the ability to register, configure, and execute third-party plugins.
   - Test fallback scenarios for faulty or unresponsive plugins.
   - Integration tests that monitor the availability with third party systems
   - Evenually vendonring when possible to have reliable integrations

4. **Batch Operations**:
   - Validate batch compliance checks for scalability and accuracy.
   - Test parallel task execution and consolidated reporting for batch requests.

5. **Reporting Service**:
   - Ensure public/private visibility settings work as expected.
   - Validate export functionality for reports in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, JSON).
   - Test detailed compliance scoring, including multi-standard comparisons.

6. **Dashboard and User Interface**:
   - Verify usability and responsiveness across devices.
   - Test interaction flows for developers (e.g., scheduling, report generation) and end-users (e.g., browsing public reports).
   - Just for importnat red-routes we planned to have UI end-2-end testing with the Playwright platfrom tests suites

8. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Confirm integration of Prometheus and Grafana for system health metrics.
   - Validate alerting mechanisms for critical issues in compliance workflows or API responses.

## 2. Validation Environments and Scenarios
### Environments:
1. **Local Development Environment**:
   - Use Docker to deploy all services locally.
   - Employ mock services (e.g., Mailhog, external API mocks) to simulate third-party interactions.

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Deploy a replica of the production environment with isolated databases and real service integrations.
   - Enable Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring during validation.

### Scenarios Aligned with User Needs:
1. **Developer Use Case**:
   - Submit a service for compliance checks and validate the accuracy of conformance scores.
   - Test scheduling periodic compliance checks and generating detailed reports.
   - CLI is working correctly and submits correct values to the API Gateway
   - REST API works correctly as the CLI
   - user workflows if broken report detailed debugging error messages
   - The devs should be able to replicate the actions and see where the error happens

3. **End-User Use Case**:
   - Browse public reports and compare services based on compliance scores.
   - Validate the usability and responsiveness of the dashboard.
   - Can submit Credential issuers to verify the conformance of them

4. **Stress and Load Testing**:
   - Simulate high-concurrency batch compliance checks.
   - Test system behavior under load using tools like Apache JMeter or k6.

5. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Introduce simulated outages and verify recovery mechanisms for Temporal workflows.
   - Test fallback logic for third-party plugin failures.

## 3. Demonstration Approach
### Goals:
- Showcase the capabilities of **DIDImo** in realistic, user-focused scenarios.
- Highlight the solution's robustness, usability, and adaptability to changing conditions.

### Steps:
1. **Setup**:
   - Deploy the solution in a staging environment configured with real integrations and monitoring tools.
   - Load realistic test data for compliance workflows and organizational setups.

2. **Real-World Simulations**:
   - Demonstrate submitting services for compliance checks, showcasing workflows from submission to report generation.
   - Show the ability to toggle report visibility and claim organizational ownership.

3. **Scenario-Based Demonstrations**:
   - **Developer Perspective**:
     - Submit a batch of services for compliance checks.
     - Schedule periodic checks and review detailed reports.
   - **End-User Perspective**:
     - Browse public reports and compare service compliance scores.
     - Access detailed compliance data for informed decision-making.
   - **Service Provider Perspective**:
     - Manage privacy settings for reports and claim organizational ownership.

4. **Stress and Fault Tolerance**:
   - Execute a high-volume batch of compliance checks to demonstrate system scalability.
   - Simulate service outages and showcase the resilience of Temporal workflows.

5. **Monitoring and Debugging**:
   - Use Prometheus and Grafana to visualize system metrics during the demonstration.
   - Showcase Temporalâ€™s ability to inspect, replay, and debug workflows.

### Deliverables:
- Detailed validation reports for all modules and functionalities.
- Recorded demonstrations showcasing key use cases and scenarios.
- Feedback from stakeholders to inform further refinements.
