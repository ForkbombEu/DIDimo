The following system diagrams provide a visual overview of the Credimi platform, illustrating its architecture and key components. These diagrams are based on the C4 model, which is a widely-used approach for visualizing software architecture.

While we follow the principles of the C4 model, our implementation is somewhat loose, focusing on clarity and relevance to the specific context of Credimi. The diagrams capture different levels of abstraction, from the overall system context down to detailed component interactions within the platform. This structured approach helps in understanding how various parts of the system interact and contribute to its overall functionality.


## System Context diagrams

Shows the interaction between external actors (developers, service providers, governmental bodies, etc.) and the Credimi system.
