# 🔧 Implement & 🐳 deployment

## Strategies and Processes

This subsection outlines the specific methods and steps for integrating and deploying the Credimi solution, emphasizing its evolution through a user-centric approach. The architecture design was refined significantly based on feedback gathered through detailed questionnaires and user interviews. This feedback highlighted the need for robust handling of long-running tasks, seamless scheduling, and fault tolerance, leading to the introduction of Temporal.io into the architecture.

The inclusion of Temporal.io enables Credimi to deliver enhanced capabilities, such as reliable state management, advanced scheduling, exponential retry mechanisms, and support for human-in-the-loop workflows. These benefits directly address user needs for scalability, resilience, and usability, making the platform more adaptable and effective in managing compliance workflows and reporting processes.

Through this iterative design process, Credimi now leverages Temporal.io alongside a modular API and robust monitoring stack, ensuring it provides an intuitive, reliable, and user-focused conformance tool for verifying and managing compliance with European digital identity standards.

### Step-by-Step Deployment

The deployment process for Credimi is streamlined through a fully containerized infrastructure managed by Docker. Each component, from the backend services to monitoring tools, is packaged into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

1. Containerized Services: All core components (e.g., API gateway, Temporal.io, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Prometheus) are deployed as Docker containers for seamless integration and scalability.
2. Mock Services for Testing:
    - Mailhog simulates mailing functionality, ensuring email workflows can be tested without external dependencies.
    - A third-party simulator acts as a mock for external compliance tools, introducing intentional faults to stress-test the system.
    - Additional external API mocks ensure all integrations are validated before real-world connections are established.
3. Pre-Staging Validation: Before progressing to the staging environment, these mocks provide a controlled setup to test all workflows and API interactions comprehensively.

This containerized and mock-driven approach reduces dependency risks, accelerates testing, and ensures a reliable transition to staging and production environments.
