## Objective

Test that a non-negative integer indicates that the respective index in an array is to be selected.

## Preconditions

```json
{
  "name": "Arthur Dent",
  "address": {
    "street_address": "42 Market Street",
    "locality": "Milliways",
    "postal_code": "12345"
  },
  "degrees": [
    {
      "type": "Bachelor of Science",
      "university": "University of Betelgeuse"
    },
    {
      "type": "Master of Science",
      "university": "University of Betelgeuse"
    }
  ],
  "nationalities": ["British", "Betelgeusian"]
}
```

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction.
2. Verifier sends an Authorization Request with a DCQL query containing a claims path pointer where one element is a non-negative integer and the currently selected element at that position is an array (e.g. path: ["nationalities", 1]).
3. Wallet parses the Authorization Request and the DCQL query.
4. Wallet evaluates the claims path pointer against the matching JSON-based Credential.
5. Wallet selects the array element at the index indicated by the integer.
6. Wallet generates and returns the Authorization Response.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Authorization Request and the DCQL query.
4. Wallet correctly resolves the path pointer up to the integer element.
5. Wallet selects the array element at the specified index (e.g. "Betelgeusian" for path: ["nationalities", 1], where nationalities[1] = "Betelgeusian").
6. Wallet returns an Authorization Response containing only the selected array element value.
