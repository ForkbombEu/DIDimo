## Preconditions

```json
{
  "name": "Arthur Dent",
  "address": {
    "street_address": "42 Market Street",
    "locality": "Milliways",
    "postal_code": "12345"
  },
  "degrees": [
    {
      "type": "Bachelor of Science",
      "university": "University of Betelgeuse"
    },
    {
      "type": "Master of Science",
      "university": "University of Betelgeuse"
    }
  ],
  "nationalities": ["British", "Betelgeusian"]
}
```

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction.
2. Verifier sends an Authorization Request with a DCQL query containing a claims path pointer where one element is null and the currently selected element at that position is an array (e.g. path: ["degrees", null, "type"]).
3. Wallet parses the Authorization Request and the DCQL query.
4. Wallet evaluates the claims path pointer against the matching JSON-based Credential.
5. Wallet expands the null element to select all elements of the currently selected array(s).
6. Wallet generates and returns the Authorization Response.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Authorization Request and the DCQL query.
4. Wallet correctly resolves the path pointer up to the null element.
5. Wallet selects all elements of the currently selected array(s) at the null position (e.g. all type values across all entries of the degrees array).
6. Wallet returns an Authorization Response containing all selected claim values.
