## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. Verifier Client Metadata does not include any other hash algorithms.

## Test Scenario

1. Wallet engages with the Verifier.
2. Wallet receives the Authorization Request whose client metadata advertises SHA-256 only.
3. Wallet returns the Authorization Response and receives the response acknowledging the presentation.

## Expected results

1. Wallet successfully initiates the interaction and
2. Wallet receives the Authorization Request advertising SHA-256 only.
3. Wallet sends an Authorization Response whose vp_token holds SHA-256-based digests.
