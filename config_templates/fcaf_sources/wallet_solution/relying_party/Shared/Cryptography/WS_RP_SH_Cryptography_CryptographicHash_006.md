## Preconditions

1. There is a defined mechanism for this Wallet profile, through which Verifier receives Wallet Metadata.

## Test Scenario

1. Verify if Wallet includes other hash algorithms supported (besides SHA-256) in its Metadata.

## Expected results

1. Wallet does include other hash algorithms supported (besides SHA-256) in its Metadata.
