# WS_RP_SH_Cryptography_Encryption002

## Objective

Verify that if `encrypted_response_enc_values_supported` within client metadata from the Verifier, does not include A256GCM, and Wallet only supports A256GCM, the Wallet responds with an error.

## References

- [OpenID4VP] Section 8.3
- [RFC7516] Section 4.1.2

## Profile applicability

Wallet supports only A256GCM

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request using response mode direct_post.jwt, whose client metadata lists encrypted_response_enc_values_supported without A256GCM.
3. Wallet processes the request.
4. Wallet returns its response to the Authorization Request.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives the Authorization Request
3. Wallet successfully proccesses request.
4. Wallet returns an access_denied error.
