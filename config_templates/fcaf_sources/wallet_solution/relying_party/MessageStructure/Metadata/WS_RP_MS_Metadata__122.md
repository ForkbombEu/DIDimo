## Preconditions

1. Wallet has a configured list of trusted issuers for Verifier Attestation JWTs.

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives a Request Object using verifier_attestation: prefix; the attestation JWT contains NO redirect_uris claim.
3. Wallet parses the Request Object and the attestation JWT.
4. Wallet checks for the redirect_uris claim and finds none.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Request Object.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Request Object and the attestation JWT.
4. Wallet does not enforce redirect_uri against the attestation; request is processed normally; presentation flow proceeds.
