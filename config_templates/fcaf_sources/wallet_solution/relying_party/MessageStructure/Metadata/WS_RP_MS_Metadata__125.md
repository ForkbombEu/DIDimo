## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives a Request Object using x509_san_dns: prefix where the DNS name in the Client Identifier matches a dNSName SAN entry in the leaf certificate.
3. Wallet parses the Request Object and the x5c chain.
4. Wallet compares the DNS name in the Client Identifier against the SAN entries of the leaf certificate.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Request Object.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Request Object and the x5c chain.
4. Wallet verifies the DNS name matches a SAN dNSName; request is accepted; presentation flow proceeds.
