## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request using the openid_federation: prefix containing a trust_chain parameter that cannot be validated (malformed, unresolvable, or not trusted).

4. Wallet attempts to validate the trust_chain.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
