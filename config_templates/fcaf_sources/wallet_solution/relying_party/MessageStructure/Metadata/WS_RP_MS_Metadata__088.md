# WS_RP_MS_Metadata_088

## Objective

Verify that the EUDI Wallet accepts a JOSE-based Referenced Token where the "uri" claim within "status_list" is a valid URI per RFC 3986.

## References

- [Token Status List] Section 6.2

## Profile applicability

The Wallet supports revocation checking via the Token Status List mechanism; The Wallet supports Status List Tokens in JWT format

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. The EUDI Wallet requests and receives a valid Referenced Token issued by an Issuer
2. The Referenced Token includes the Status element that contains the Status_list element (index and URI)
3. The EUDI Wallet has retrieved a Status List Token from the referenced URI
4. The Status List Token is validated
5. The Issuer has provided a JOSE-based Referenced Token to the EUDI Wallet.
6. The Referenced Token contains the "uri" claim within "status_list" set to a valid URI per RFC 3986.

## Test Scenario

1. Verify the value of the "uri" claim within "status_list".

## Expected results

1. The "uri" value is a valid URI and the token is accepted.
