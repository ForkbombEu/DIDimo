## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request using the origin: Client Identifier Prefix outside of a DC API context (e.g. via redirect or request_uri flow).
3. Wallet parses the Authorization Request.
4. Wallet detects the origin: prefix in a non-DC-API context.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Authorization Request.
4. Wallet rejects the Authorization Request and returns an invalid_request error (origin: prefix MUST NOT be accepted outside DC API); presentation flow is not initiated.
