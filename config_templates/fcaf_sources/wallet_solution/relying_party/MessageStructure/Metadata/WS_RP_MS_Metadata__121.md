## Preconditions

1. Wallet has a configured list of trusted issuers for Verifier Attestation JWTs.

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives a Request Object using verifier_attestation: prefix where the redirect_uri request parameter does NOT match any entry in the attestation JWT's redirect_uris claim.
3. Wallet parses the Request Object and the attestation JWT.
4. Wallet compares the redirect_uri parameter against the redirect_uris claim entries.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Request Object.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Request Object and the attestation JWT.
4. Wallet rejects the Request Object and returns an invalid_request error due to redirect_uri mismatch; presentation flow is not initiated.
