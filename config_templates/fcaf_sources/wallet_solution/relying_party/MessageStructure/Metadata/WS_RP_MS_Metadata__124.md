## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives a Request Object using verifier_attestation: prefix; all non-key Verifier metadata is included in client_metadata.
3. Wallet parses the Request Object.
4. Wallet extracts non-key Verifier metadata from client_metadata.

## Expected results

4. Wallet obtains all Verifier metadata (except public key) exclusively from client_metadata; presentation flow proceeds.
