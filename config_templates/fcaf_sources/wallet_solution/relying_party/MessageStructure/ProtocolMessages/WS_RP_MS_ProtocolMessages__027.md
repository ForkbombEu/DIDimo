## Preconditions

1. Applicable only if tested in combination with a specific transaction data type.

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Verifier sends an Authorization Request containing a transaction_data object whose credential_ids array includes at least one string that does not match any id in the dcql_query.
3. Wallet parses the transaction_data and cross-references credential_ids against the dcql_query.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives and parses the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet returns an invalid_transaction_data error; presentation flow is not initiated.
