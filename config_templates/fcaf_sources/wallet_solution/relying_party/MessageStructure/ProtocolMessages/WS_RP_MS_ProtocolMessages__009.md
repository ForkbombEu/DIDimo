## References

- [OpenID4VP] Section 5

## Profile applicability

None

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. Wallet holds at least one credential that can match a valid DCQL query, and a second scenario where no matching credential is available.

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Verifier sends a Request Object containing both client_id AND iss claim, with iss value different from client_id.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet processes the Authorization Request successfully; iss claim is silently ignored; Verifier is identified by the client_id claim only.
