## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request where client_id in the query and client_id in the Request Object differ.
3. Wallet parses the query string and the Request Object.
4. Wallet compares the two client_id values.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully parses both sources.
4. Wallet terminates processing and returns an invalid_request error due to client_id mismatch; presentation flow is not initiated.
