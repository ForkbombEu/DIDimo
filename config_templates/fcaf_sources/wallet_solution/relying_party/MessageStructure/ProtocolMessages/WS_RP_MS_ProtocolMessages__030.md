## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request containing only a scope parameter with a value NOT recognized by the Wallet.
3. Wallet parses the Authorization Request and attempts to resolve the scope value.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives and parses the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet rejects the Authorization Request and returns an invalid_scope error; presentation flow is not initiated.
