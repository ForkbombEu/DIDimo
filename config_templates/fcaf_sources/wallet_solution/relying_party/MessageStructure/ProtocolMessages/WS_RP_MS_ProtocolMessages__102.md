## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the Verifier.
2. Verifier sends a DCQL query with a "credential_sets" property, including "required" property set as true for a set containing a PID that the wallet is missing. No other sets available.
3. The Wallet evaluates the request.

## Expected results

1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. Wallet receives the request.
3. The Wallet realises it doesn't have PID and sees "required": true, hence it must NOT offer this set. No other sets are available, so the transaction stops, making sure it sends a privacy preserving response.
