## Preconditions

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the verifier.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization request with response_type=vp_token, but omitting both the dcql_query & any scope values referencing a credential.
3. Wallet processes the request and identifies no data requirements provided.
4. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. True: The Wallet does NOT proceed to credential selection or user authorization.
4. Verify: The Wallet returns an error response where the error parameter is exactly invalid_request.
