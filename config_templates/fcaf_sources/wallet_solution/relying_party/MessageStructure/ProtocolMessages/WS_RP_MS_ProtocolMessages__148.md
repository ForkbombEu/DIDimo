## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with verifier.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization request for credentials the wallet does have.
3. Wallet processes request.
4. The User explicitly does NOT give consent to share requested credential.
5. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. The Wallet proceeds to credential selection or user authorization.
4. The wallet detects the user's denial of consent and does not proceed with credential presentation.
5. The Wallet does NOT return a vp_token, instead it returns an error response, where the error parameter is exactly access_denied.
