## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request where client_id is present in both the query string and the Request Object claim, identical (including the Client Identifier Prefix).
3. Wallet parses the query string and the Request Object.
4. Wallet compares the two client_id values.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully parses both sources.
4. Wallet verifies the client_id values match exactly; request is processed; presentation flow proceeds.
