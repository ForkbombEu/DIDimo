## References

- [OpenID4VP] Section 5
- [RFC6749]

## Profile applicability

None

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. The Authorization Request parameters under test apply to both regular Authorization Requests and Authorization Requests delivered via a Request Object (signed JWT, passed by value or by reference via request_uri).

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. The Wallet receives an Authorization Request containing one or more unrecognized parameters that are NOT transaction_data.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet ignores all unrecognized parameters and proceeds with the presentation flow as if those parameters were absent. No error is returned.
