## Objective

Verify that the Wallet returns invalid_client when the client_id resolves to a trusted registry entry, but the request attempts to override it with dynamic client_metadata.

## References

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. The Wallet is configured to resolve the client_id, via a trusted registry where Verifier A is pre-registered.

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with verifier A.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization request containing both a known client_id, and a client_metadata parameter.
3. Wallet identifies the conflict between the incoming metadata and the pre-registered client.
4. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. True: The Wallet does NOT proceed to credential selection or user authorization.
4. Verify: The Wallet returns an error response where the error parameter is exactly invalid_client.
