## Test Scenario

3. The Wallet evaluates the request.

## Expected results

1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. Wallet receives the request.
3. The wallet rejects the request by either:
    1. answering with an error with details (`invalid_request`),
    2. answering with an error without providing details or,
    3. discontinuing the interaction.
