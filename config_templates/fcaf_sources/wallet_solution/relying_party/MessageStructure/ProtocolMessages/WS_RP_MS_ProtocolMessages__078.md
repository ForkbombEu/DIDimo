## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the Verifier.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization Request with a DCQL-query with a credential with a non-empty, non-array type "trusted_authorities" property.
3. The Wallet evaluates the request.

## Expected results

1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. Wallet receives the request.
3. Wallet rejects the request by either:
    1. answering with an error with details (`invalid_request`),
    2. answering with an error without providing details or,
    3. discontinuing the interaction.
