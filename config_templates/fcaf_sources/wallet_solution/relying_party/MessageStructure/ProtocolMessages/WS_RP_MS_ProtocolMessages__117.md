## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the Verifier.
2. Verifier sends a DCQL query, with "credentials" asking for 2 credentials, "credential_sets" is NOT included.
3. Wallet handles query.

## Expected results

1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. Wallet received query.
3. The Wallet interprets the missing credential_sets as a mandatory request for all defined credentials without any "credential_sets" rules.
    1. The Wallet offers both credentials to the user as a single, required bundle.
    2. Upon consent, the Wallet generates a Verifiable Presentation containing both credentials.
