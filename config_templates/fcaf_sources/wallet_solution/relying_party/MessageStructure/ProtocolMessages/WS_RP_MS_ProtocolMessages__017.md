## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. The Authorization Request parameters under test apply to both regular Authorization Requests and Authorization Requests delivered via a Request Object (signed JWT, passed by value or by reference via request_uri).

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. The Wallet receives an Authorization Request that includes the transaction_data parameter the Wallet does NOT support.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet MUST reject the Authorization Request and return an invalid_transaction_data error; the presentation flow is NOT initiated.
