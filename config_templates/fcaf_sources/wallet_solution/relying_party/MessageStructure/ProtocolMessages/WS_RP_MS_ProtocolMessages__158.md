## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with Verifier.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization request including a transaction_data object that references a different set of IDs than the credentials requested.
3. Wallet processes request and the transaction_data structure.
4. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. Wallet identifies mismatch of credential_ids.
4. Verify the Wallet does NOT proceed to the user consent screen, instead it must return an error response: invalid_transaction_data.
