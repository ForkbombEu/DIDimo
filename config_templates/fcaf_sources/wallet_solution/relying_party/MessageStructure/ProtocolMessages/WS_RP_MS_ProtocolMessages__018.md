## EUDI-wallet relevancy

## Preconditions

1. The Authorization Request parameters under test apply to both regular Authorization Requests and Authorization Requests delivered via a Request Object (signed JWT, passed by value or by reference via request_uri).

## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. The Wallet receives an Authorization Request that includes a valid transaction_data parameter to a Wallet that DOES support it.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet processes transaction_data correctly and proceeds with the presentation flow.
