## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with verifier.

3. Wallet processes request.
4. The User fails authentication.
5. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated
2. Wallet receives request
3. The Wallet proceeds to credential selection or user authorization.
4. True.
5. Verify the Wallet does NOT return a vp_token, instead it returns an error response, where the error parameter is exactly access_denied.
