# WS_RP_MS_ProtocolMessages_131

## Objective

Test the Wallet will default to A128GCM for enc value, when Verifier metadata does NOT explicitly set it.

## References

- [OpenID4VP] Section 8.3.1

## Profile applicability

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the verifier.
2. The verifier sends an Authorization request to the Wallet, with response mode=direct_post.jwt, and a client_metadata object containing NO enc parameter.
3. Wallet processes request.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. Verify the Wallet returns a response, without an error, and that it uses a default enc of A128GCM to perform its encryption.
