## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the verifier.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization request with a scope value that is intentionally malformed (e.g. illegal characters).
3. Wallet processes the request and identifies the scope as invalid.
4. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. The Wallet does NOT proceed to credential selection or user authorization.
4. The Wallet returns an error response where the error parameter is exactly invalid_scope.
