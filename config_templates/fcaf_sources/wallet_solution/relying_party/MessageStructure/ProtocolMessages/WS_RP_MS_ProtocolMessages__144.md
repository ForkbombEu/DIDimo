## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the verifier.
2. The Verifier sends an Authorization request using client_id prefix HTTPS, but the request is sent as plain unsigned URL parameters, instead of a Signed Request Object (JWT).
3. Wallet processes the request and identifies security violation for the prefix.
4. Test the response returned by the Wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. True: The Wallet does NOT proceed to credential selection or user authorization.
4. Verify: The Wallet returns an error response where the error parameter is exactly invalid_request.
