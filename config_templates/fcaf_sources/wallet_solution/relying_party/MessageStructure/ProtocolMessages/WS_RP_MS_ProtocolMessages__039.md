## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request using the redirect_uri: prefix where the embedded URI is not a valid HTTPS URL (e.g. malformed URI or non-HTTPS scheme).
3. Wallet parses the Authorization Request.
4. Wallet validates the embedded URI.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Authorization Request.
4. Wallet rejects the Authorization Request and returns an invalid_request error due to the invalid redirect URI; presentation flow is not initiated.
