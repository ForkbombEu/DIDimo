## Profile applicability

The EUDI wallet contains a Credential in mdoc format with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1".

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_specific | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. A device retrieval mdoc request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve the document with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1".
2. All mandatory data elements within namespace "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested.
3. The device retrieval mdoc response was retrieved.
4. The presence of data element `place_of_birth` in the device retrieval mdoc response was verified.

## Test Scenario

For each item present, perform the following check:
1. Verify the value of the key for each nested key/value pair.
2. Verify that each key is unique within the data item.

## Expected results

1. The data element item contains between 1 and 3 pairs inclusive, with the following value(s) for the key/ value pair(s):
    - "country" (optional)
    - "region" (optional)
    - "locality" (optional)
2. Each key is unique within the data item.
