## Preconditions

1. A device retrieval mdoc request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve the document with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1".
2. All mandatory data elements within namespace "org.iso.18013.5.1" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested.
3. The device retrieval mdoc response was retrieved.
4. The presence of data element `issuance_date` in the device retrieval mdoc response was verified.

## Test Scenario

1. Verify the value of date-fullyear.
2. Verify the value of date-month.
3. Verify the value of date-mday.
4. If present, verify the value of all time-hour.
5. If present, verify the value of all time-minute.
6. If present, verify the value of time-second.

## Expected results

1. The value of date-fullyear is between "0000" and "9999" inclusive.
2. The value of date-month is between "01" and "12" inclusive.
3. The value of date-mday is between "01" and the maximum value specified in section 5.7 of RFC 3339 inclusive.
