## References

- [PID rulebook] Annex 3.01, Section 4.1 (Table 6)
- [RFC3339] Section 5.6

## Profile applicability

The EUDI wallet contains a Credential in mdoc format with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1". Data element `expiry_date` is present in the mdoc data.

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_specific | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. A device retrieval mdoc request was sent to the EUDI wallet, to retrieve the document with DocType = "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1".
2. All mandatory data elements within namespace "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1" and all data elements indicated as present in the ICS were requested.
3. The device retrieval mdoc response was retrieved.
4. The presence of data element `expiry_date` in the device retrieval mdoc response was verified.

## Test Scenario

1. Verify the length of the data element.
2. Verify the characters used in the format of the DataElementValue of the data element.

## Expected results

1. If the value of the tag is equal to:
    - 0, the length of the data element is equal to 20 UTF-8 encoded characters.
    - 1004, the length of the data element is equal to 10 UTF-8 encoded characters.
2. If the value of the tag is equal to:
    - 0, the characters used have the following format: date-fullyear "-" date-month "-" date-mday "T" time-hour ":" time-minute ":" time-second time-offset.
    - 1004, the characters used have the following format: date-fullyear "-" date-month "-" date-mday.

    Where:

    - date-fullyear consists of four decimal digits.
    - date-month, date-mday, time-hour, time-minute and time-second consist of two decimal digits.
    - time-offset consists of one character: "Z".
