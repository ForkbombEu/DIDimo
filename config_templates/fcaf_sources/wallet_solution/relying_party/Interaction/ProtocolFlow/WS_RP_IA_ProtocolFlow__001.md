## Test Scenario

2. Wallet receives an Authorization Request with request_uri_method = post.
3. Wallet sends a POST request and receives a Request Object containing all required Authorization Request parameters.
4. The Wallet processes the request and sends an Authorization Response to the Verifier.

## Expected results

2. Wallet successfully receives the Authorization Request.
3. Wallet successfully receives the Request Object.
4. The Authorization Response sent by the Wallet is consistent with the parameter values from the Request Object.
