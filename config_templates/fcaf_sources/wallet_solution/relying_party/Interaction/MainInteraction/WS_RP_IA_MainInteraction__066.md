## Objective

Verify the HAIP requirement that, in the presentation flow via Redirects, Wallet raises an error if Verifier does not include `redirect_uri` in the HTTP response to the Wallet's HTTP POST to the `response_uri`, as defined in section 8.2 of [OIDF.OID4VP].

## Test Scenario

1. End-user interacts with the Verifier, triggering the Verifier to send a presentation request.
2. Verifier sends presentation request using `response_mode` `direct_post.jwt` and including `response_uri`.
3. Verify if Wallet sends HTTP POST to `response_uri`.
4. Verifier response to Wallet HTTP POST does not include `redirect_uri`.
5. Wallet processes the request.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. Wallet successfully sends the HTTP POST payload to the response_uri.
4. The Verifier's response is received without a redirect_uri parameter.
5. The Wallet raises an invalid_request error or terminates transaction.
