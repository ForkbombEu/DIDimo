## Test Scenario

1. The wallet engages with the verifier.
2. The verifier sends an Authorization request, with response_type=vp_token, response_mode=direct_post.jwt and parameter response_uri.
3. The wallet performs HTTP POST to the response_uri.
4. The verifier responds with HTTP error 400 and a JSON body containing a redirect_uri.
5. Wallet processes error and the JSON and triggers User agent.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet receives request.
3. The wallet posts the Authorization Response to the response_uri.
4. Verify the Wallet recognizes the HTTP error status but successfully parses the redirect_uri from the error response body.
5. Wallet opens redirect_uri
