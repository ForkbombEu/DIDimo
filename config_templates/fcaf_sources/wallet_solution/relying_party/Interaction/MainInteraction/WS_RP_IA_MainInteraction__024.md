# WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction_024

## Objective

Verify that if the Wallet cannot pre-parse the data (e.g., it's encrypted), it still allows the user to proceed with the presentation rather than failing the request.

## References

- [OpenID4VP] Section 6.4

## Profile applicability

Encrypted data

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. Verifier sends a DCQL query with a values restriction. The Wallet holds a matching credential, but the data is encrypted/locked (the Wallet can't check the value yet).

## Expected results

1. The Wallet identifies the Type matches and allows the user to present the credential anyway (as the Credential Type and Path match the request.)
