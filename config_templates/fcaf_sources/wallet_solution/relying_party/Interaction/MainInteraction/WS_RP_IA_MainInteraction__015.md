# WS_RP_IA_MainInteraction_015

## Objective

A Credential presentation may include "extra" claims not selected according to rules, if they are non-selective (fixed) technical fields that cannot be hidden.

## References

- [OpenID4VP] Section 6.4

## Profile applicability

None

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. Wallet has an SD-JWT credential. By definition, the vct (type) and iss (issuer) fields are fixed/mandatory and cannot be hidden.

## Test Scenario

1. The Wallet engages with the Verifier.
2. Verifier sends a DCQL query asking only for `given_name`.
3. Response

## Expected results

1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. The Wallet selects `given_name` but must also include the mandatory envelope data required to make the credential cryptographically valid.
3. The vp_token contains `given_name` PLUS the mandatory technical fields (e.g., vct, iss, iat).
