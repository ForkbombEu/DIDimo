## Preconditions

3. The Wallet processes the request, the user Authorizes the presentation, and the wallet transmits the response payload.

## Expected results

1. Wallet and Verifier can interact.
2. The Wallet prompts the user to release the requested credential.
3. The Verifier receives an Authorization Response where the top-level keys within the vp_token object exactly match the credential query ID specified in the request.
