## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. Device is under extreme load

## Test Scenario

1. The wallet engages with verifier.
2. The verifier sends a valid Authorization request.
3. Wallet processes request
4. Test the response returned by the wallet to the Verifier.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated
2. Wallet receives request.
3. Wallet cannot process request due to RAM/disk space.
4. Verify the Wallet does NOT return a credential; instead, it returns an error response where the error parameter is exactly wallet_unavailable.
