## Test Scenario

1. End-user interacts with the Verifier, triggering the Verifier to send a presentation request.
2. Verifier sends presentation request including 2 authorization requests, ephemeral public key `key1` for authorization request 1 and ephemeral public key `key2` for authorization request 2.
3. Verify if Wallet uses the correctly ephemeral public key for each one of the authorization requests in the response encryption process.

## Expected results

1. This is the case.
2. Wallet uses `key1` as input for key agreement included in the encryption process of the response related to "authorization request 1".
3. Wallet uses `key2` as input for key agreement included in the encryption process of the response related to "authorization request 2".
