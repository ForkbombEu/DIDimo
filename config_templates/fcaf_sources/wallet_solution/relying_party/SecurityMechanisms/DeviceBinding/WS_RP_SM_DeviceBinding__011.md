# WS_RP_SM_DeviceBinding_011

## Objective

Verify that when Wallet uses `cnf` claim within the SD-JWT component of the SD-JWT VC as described in [I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc], the KB-JWT in the presentation of the SD-JWT is secured by the key identified in `cnf` claim.

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

1. The Wallet holds a valid SD-JWT VC credential that supports Cryptographic Key Binding.

## Test Scenario

1. End-user interacts with the Verifier, triggering the Verifier to send a presentation request.
2. Verifier requests presentation from a Credential in IETF SD-JWT VC Credential format that supports and/or requires Cryptographic Key Binding.
3. Wallet asks for user consent to present the Credential.
4. User gives consent.
5. Wallet presents Credential in IETF SD-JWT VC format.
6. Check `cnf` claim is used within the SD-JWT component of the SD-JWT VC.
7. Verify that the KB-JWT in the presentation of the SD-JWT is secured by the key identified in 'cnf' claim.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is initiated.
2. Wallet receives the presentation request.
3. Wallet asks for user consent.
4. User consent is registered.
5. Wallet presents Credential in IETF SD-JWT VC format.
6. The 'cnf' claim is successfully used within the SD-JWT component of the SD-JWT VC response payload.
7. Verify that the KB-JWT in the presentation of the SD-JWT is secured by the key identified in the 'cnf' claim.
