## Preconditions

1. A Signature from authorization request is authentic.

## Test Scenario

1. End-user interacts with the Verifier, triggering the Verifier to send a presentation request.
2. Verifier sends Signed Authorization Request using JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) [RFC9101] with the `request_uri` parameter, and signature is authentic.
3. Verify if the Wallet obtains the request object from the `request_uri`.
4. Wallet checks signature on the request object.

## Expected results

1. This is the case.
2. This is the case.
3. Wallet obtains the request object from the `request_uri`.
4. Signature validation fails and Wallet either:
    - (a) answers with an error with details (`invalid_request_object`),
    - (b) answers with an error without providing details or,
    - (c) discontinues the interaction.
