# WS_RP_SM_RpIntegrity_031

## Objective

Verify that Wallet supports ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 (JOSE algorithm identifier ES256) for validating signed presentation requests.

## References

- [HAIP] Section 7

## Profile applicability

JOSE algorithm identifier ES256

## EUDI-wallet relevancy

EUDI_generic | EUDI_required

## Preconditions

None

## Test Scenario

1. Verify that Wallet receives signed request using ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 (JOSE algorithm identifier ES256) from the Verifier.
2. Verify if Wallet is able to validate signed request from the Verifier that used ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 (JOSE algorithm identifier ES256)

## Expected results

1. Wallet receives signed request using ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 (JOSE algorithm identifier ES256) from the Verifier.
2. Wallet is able to validate signed request from the Verifier that used ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 (JOSE algorithm identifier ES256)
