## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives a Request Object via DC API where audience uses the origin: prefix and all non-key Verifier metadata is in client_metadata.
3. Wallet parses the Request Object.
4. Wallet processes the audience as `origin:<origin>` per DC API rules.
5. Wallet uses client_metadata for non-key Verifier metadata.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction via the DC API is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Request Object.
3. Wallet successfully parses the Request Object.
4. Wallet processes the audience correctly per DC API rules.
5. Wallet uses client_metadata for all non-key Verifier metadata; presentation flow proceeds within the DC API context.
