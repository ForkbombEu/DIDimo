## Test Scenario

1. Engage wallet-verifier interaction (e.g. click link / scan QR code).
2. Wallet receives a Request Object using x509_hash: prefix where some non-key Verifier metadata is provided outside the client_metadata parameter.
3. Wallet parses the Request Object.
4. Wallet extracts Verifier metadata from the Request Object.

## Expected results

1. Wallet-verifier interaction is successfully initiated.
2. Wallet successfully receives the Request Object.
